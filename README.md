# Gun Project Prototype 

This repository contains a **real-world project prototype** built with Flutter/Android Studio. The project showcases various screens and features, including complex animations and custom UI components. It serves as a prototype to demonstrate the core functionality of a potential application.

## Features

- **Multiple Animation Screens**: Smooth and engaging animations to enhance user experience.
- **Horizontally Scrollable Layout**: Implemented using `PageView.builder`, with a custom widget (`Gunsforyou`) displaying items in a scrollable container with page indicators.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Allows users to switch between key sections like `HomePage`, `ScannerPage`, and `UserProfile`.
- **Authentication**: Includes a `SigninScreen` for user login, providing a modern, streamlined interface.
- **Prototype Data**: Showcases a list of gun items (e.g., `Revolver`, `Glock`, `Single action`, `Compact`, `gun5`, `gun6`) for demonstration purposes.

## Screens Implemented

1. **SigninScreen**: Prototype for user authentication.
2. **HomeScreen**: Main navigation hub with a `BottomNavigationBar`.
3. **Animation Screens**: Various screens demonstrating animation techniques, used to create a dynamic user experience.
4. **Gunsforyou PageView**: A horizontally scrollable container with page indicators displaying the gun items list.
